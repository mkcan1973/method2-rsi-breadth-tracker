"""
Reconstructs the RSI+breadth trade history (entries/exits, open vs
closed, per-trade ROI) over a trailing window, for the web summary.

Uses the exact same signal logic validated for method2 and used live in
scan.py -- this is a reporting view of that same signal, not a separate
calculation that could drift out of sync with it.

Entry/exit price convention: the day a signal fires (RSI crosses a
threshold, with breadth already satisfying the filter, at that day's
close) is a detection, not a fill -- you can't act on a close until the
next session opens. Both entry and exit price are therefore the NEXT
trading day's open after the signal-crossing close, applied
symmetrically (same convention validated and deployed for method1).

Breadth is a MARKET-WIDE series, not a per-symbol one -- it has to be
computed once across the whole universe before any single symbol's
position series can be built, unlike RSI which only needs that symbol's
own bars.
