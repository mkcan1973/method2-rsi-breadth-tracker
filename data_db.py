"""
SQLite store of daily OHLCV bars, one row per (symbol, date).

Mirrors the connect()/upsert()/load_*() pattern from seasonal/seasonal_db.py.
Every row is tagged with its data source so backtest history and anything
logged later (e.g. live scan predictions in a separate table) are never
ambiguous about provenance.
